# Tech-blog
*Within Tech blog, you can share your thoughts over topics in the tech industry that others may want to read or learn about*.

## User Story:

As web developers know, writing about tech could be just as important as making it. Most developers invest some time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. Now a days a simple Google search for any concept you want to know more about, returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels! The assignment here was to build a blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. Therefore you'll now give back to the open source community and share what you've learned helping others succeed, stay calm and thrive on!

## Future Developments:

1. As for furture developments I would like to create a option button, that allows the user to create comments on an existing post.
2. Edit the homepage as soon as you open the app to render an image containing the tech blogs logo.
3. Get the log out button functionality to work properly.
4. Give the blog a distinctive design.

All of these issues will be applied soon! So stay tuned for the latest version, Thank you for your patience!

## Credits

I want to give a shoutout to Leah, my instructor for help making more sense of how models, views, and controllers (MVC) operates and it's importance on how it all connects making the app function properly.
Also thanks to my tutor Mr. Clements Team work makes the dream work!
